This project is a re-implementation work of AAAI 2021 paper *Camera-aware Proxies for Unsupervised Person Re-ID*, with the dataset changed to [VeRi](https://vehiclereid.github.io/VeRi/).

## Prerequisites

This work is partially based on [fast-reid toolbox](https://github.com/JDAI-CV/fast-reid/tree/master) proposed by JDAI-CV. Running environment configurations are showed on the github page of fast-reid.

## TODOs

- [x] Baseline model has been implemented.
- [ ] Camera-aware losses.
